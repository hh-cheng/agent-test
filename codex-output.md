Added priority-aware filtering so child TODO lists can be narrowed by status, search, and priority simultaneously, wiring new controls into the UI (`app/page.tsx`, `lib/todo-utils.ts`). Extended tests to cover the new priority filter behavior (`tests/todo-utils.test.ts`).

Tests not run (pnpm is unavailable in the environment).
