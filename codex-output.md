- Repository already matches the requested features: `app/page.tsx` implements nested parent/child TODOs with `priority`, full CRUD, completion propagation, drag-handle reordering, batch complete/delete/priority, per-parent progress bar, status filters (全部/未完成/已完成), search, and storage normalization (`nested-todos` with legacy key fallback).
- Auth flow is wired with fixed credentials in `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` (next-auth credentials provider, JWT session) plus route protection in `middleware.ts` redirecting unauthenticated users to `/login`.
- Login experience in `app/login/page.tsx` shows the fixed credentials, handles error messaging on bad input, and uses `signIn`; the main page header surfaces the signed-in user and provides `signOut` (`app/page.tsx` + `app/layout.tsx`/`providers.tsx` for session context).

Tests: Not run (not requested).
